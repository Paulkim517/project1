#Real-Time Stream App
	All subreddits stream in real-time

##Description/Motivation
-My motivation to make this was because out of all of the apps that I've tried for reddit, they've all sucked from the Google Play Store. The only decent app created for Reddit is the AMA, but that one is published by Reddit. All of the other reddit apps were made by a third-party developer.

-This is my (supposed to be) real-time stream of /r/news subreddit. (Soon going to be be all subreddits)

-User is supposed to be able to Save For Later. I wanted to implpement the OAuth to do this through Reddit itself, but for now the user will need to sign up and save for later in their new profile.
